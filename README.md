# news_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

The app allows an android or an IOS user to :

1- Have full access to a listview of all news categories to check them whenever he wants through page "newsCategories"

2- Have full access to a listview of actual news through page "homeScreen"

3- Use the settings to change the appearing language through page "Settings"

4- Search for a certain type of news based on an entered keyword "searchBar"

The app allows the user to navigate between the pages upon clicking on the 'categories' in the side menu to go to the news categories screen , then going to the chosen news upon clicking on the wanted news category , also changing the appearing language through settings (not yet implemented).
